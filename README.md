This repository contains the code required to reproduce the results of [Crystal size, shape, and conformational changes drive both the disappearance and reappearance of ritonavir polymorphs in the mill, published in https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2319127121]

```PEC-particle-energy-calculator``` is a Python code to calculate the energy of an ideal nanosized particle given a crystal structure, a lattice energy, and attachment energies for relevant hkl planes.

```population_balance_modelling_code``` is a Matlab code to reproduce the Population Balance Equation Modelling results presented in the paper.
