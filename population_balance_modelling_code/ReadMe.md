# Population Balance Modelling of Particle Size evolution during milling

Matlab code to run the Population Balance Modelling as presented
in [Crystal size, shape, and conformational changes drive both the disappearance and reappearance of ritonavir polymorphs in the mill](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2319127121).

For further details on the methodology and on the parameters used, please refer to the main work and to the Supporting information.

Please cite this paper if you use this code or any part of it.

## Requirements

- Matlab

## Usage

To reproduce the results presented in Figure 3
of [Crystal size, shape, and conformational changes drive both the disappearance and reappearance of ritonavir polymorphs in the mill](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2319127121), 
run the ```mainFully.m``` code.
